            <h5>WANT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND TO DRINK SOME COFFEE?</h5>
            <h1>COME TO OUR CAFE</h1>
            <h6>Regardless of why you’re drinking coffee, what matters most is how it tastes, smells, and whether or not it makes you feel alert and happy in the morning. That being said, everyone has their favourite order – perhaps a latte, a piccolo, or maybe a long black.</h6>

                    <h5>Caffè Americano</h5>
                    <p>You can make this type of coffee quite simply by adding hot water to a shot of espresso coffee. It has been said that American soldiers during the Second World War would make this type of coffee to make their beverages last longer. It was then (apparently) adopted by American baristas after the war.</p>

                    <h5>Café Latte (or Café au lait)</h5>
                    <p>A fairly popular option for coffee drinkers, a latte consists steamed (or scalded) milk and a single shot of coffee. It is usually quite frothy, and you’ll occasionally encounter cafes that don’t understand the difference between this and a flat white.                    </p>

                    <h5>Long Black</h5>
                    <p>Hot water is poured into a cup, and then two shots of espresso are poured into the water. If you do the inverse of this, it will result in an Americano. Long blacks can be quite strong, and have more crema (a creamy foam that tops espresso shots) than an Americano.                    </p>
